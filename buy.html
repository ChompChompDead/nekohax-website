      <h1>Buy Nekohax</h1>
      <p>
        There are several ways to buy nekohax. You can give private client
        access to the devs, give them paid client keys, or being a good friend
        of a dev. You can also apply for it in the discord. There will be other
        methods of payment soon, but for now you just have to use this.
