        <h1>Buy Nekohax</h1>
        <p>
            There are several ways to buy nekohax. 
            You can give private client access to the devs, give them paid client keys, or being a good friend of a dev. 
            You can also apply for it in the discord.
            There will be other methods of payment soon, but for now you just have to use this.
